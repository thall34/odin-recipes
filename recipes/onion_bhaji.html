        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Onion Bhaji recipe is one of my favourite recipes to have as a side for Indian cuisine. It could also be 
            described as a spiced onion fritter... Kind of like an onion ring, but way better!
        </p>
        <p>A perfect pairing for my Chicken Satay recipe</p>
