        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Shrimp Scampi recipe is one of my favourites around the house. It combines a savoury, oily dressing 
            with linguine or fettucine noodles and shrimp that all combine into a mouthwatering dish.</p>
        <p>I recommend using raw, uncooked shrimp with this recipe.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>1lb Shrimp Thawed or Fresh</li>
            <li>1/2lb Linguine/Fettucine Pasta</li>
            <li>3 cloves Garlic, Minced</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp Red Pepper Flakes</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Dry White Wine</li>
            <li>Juice of 1 Large Lemon, or 1/3 cup of Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Black Pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Parsley Flakes, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot 2/3 of the way with water and add about 2tsp of salt. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until <em>Al Dente</em>.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet.</li>
            <li>Once oil is hot, add butter until fully melted.</li>
            <li>Once fully melted, add the garlic and red pepper flakes to the pan, cook until fragrant, approx. 30secs.</li>
            <li>Add the wine to the skillet and cook until reduced by half, approx. 3-5mins.</li>
            <li>Add the shrimp and cook on each side for approx. 45secs-1min.</li>
            <li>Add the lemon juice and stir to incorporate.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta, but reserve some of the water and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta to the skillet and stir to combine. If the sauce looks separated from the noodle, add the 
                reserved pasta water.</li>
            <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper, and garnish with parsley flakes.</li>
        </ol>
